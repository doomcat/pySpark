pySpark - simple python libraries used for rapid development of virtual RoboCup
(SimSpark) agents.

Whilst SimSpark server (rcssserver3d) is easy enough to communicate with over
TCP, we had to jump over undocumented hurdles just to create a working agent
that could interact with the rest of the simulated environment.

Simple things such as sending commands to the server in the right binary
format were either undocumented or very vaguely documented.

For this reason, we've decided to release our simple python libraries on
GitHub, so that other people can develop for RoboCup events easily in Python.

INSTALLATION/USAGE GUIDE
I have yet to start using distutils or setup.py, or even format the scripts
with docstrings (or generate documentation), but using the libs should be
easy enough.

net.py -	low-level networking; requires socket and threading python
		libraries.
bot.py -	simple class for creating virtual agents.
net-test.py -	uses net, user can send raw s-statements to the simspark server.
input-maps.py -	map joytstick buttons/axes to bot actions.
main.py -	make something useful out of the libs - this spawns a bot that
		you can control using an Xbox360 controller.

Simply extract these files to wherever you want to use them, and import them
as you would for any other code.
